 abstract = {We present a novel technique based on deep learning and set theory which yields exceptional classification and prediction results. Having access to a sufficiently large amount of labeled training data, our methodology is capable of predicting the labels of the test data almost always even if the training data is entirely unrelated to the test data. In other words, we prove in a specific setting that as long as one has access to enough data points, the quality of the data is irrelevant.},
