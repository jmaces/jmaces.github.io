Before such approaches can find application in safety-critical fields, a verification of their reliability appears mandatory. Recent works have pointed out instabilities of deep neural networks for several image reconstruction tasks. In analogy to adversarial attacks in classification, it was shown that slight distortions in the input domain may cause severe artifacts. The present article sheds new light on this concern, by conducting an extensive study of the robustness of deep-learning-based algorithms for solving underdetermined inverse problems. This covers compressed sensing with Gaussian measurements as well as image recovery from Fourier and Radon measurements, including a real-world scenario for magnetic resonance imaging (using the NYU-fastMRI dataset). Our main focus is on computing adversarial perturbations of the measurements that maximize the reconstruction error. A distinctive feature of our approach is the quantitative and qualitative comparison with total-variation minimization, which serves as a provably robust reference method. In contrast to previous findings, our results reveal that standard end-to-end network architectures are not only resilient against statistical noise, but also against adversarial perturbations. All considered networks are trained by common deep learning techniques, without sophisticated defense strategies.","tags":["Deep Neural Networks","MRI","Compressed Sensing","l1-Regularization","Iterative Reconstruction Algorithm","CT Reconstruction","Adversarial Examples","Inverse Problems"],"title":"Solving Inverse Problems With Deep Neural Networks - Robustness Included?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Theophil Trippe","Martin Genzel","Jan Macdonald","Maximilian März"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1668729600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668729600,"objectID":"47116903ad0d99c998d2abdf239e089c","permalink":"https://jmaces.github.io/publication/trippe-lets-enhance-2022/","publishdate":"2023-01-22T21:11:34.703609Z","relpermalink":"/publication/trippe-lets-enhance-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"This work presents a novel deep-learning-based pipeline for the inverse problem of image deblurring, leveraging augmentation and pre-training with synthetic data. Our results build on our winning submission to the recent Helsinki Deblur Challenge 2021, whose goal was to explore the limits of state-of-the-art deblurring algorithms in a real-world data setting. The task of the challenge was to deblur out-of-focus images of random text, thereby in a downstream task, maximizing an optical-character-recognition-based score function. A key step of our solution is the data-driven estimation of the physical forward model describing the blur process. This enables a stream of synthetic data, generating pairs of ground-truth and blurry images on-the-fly, which is used for an extensive augmentation of the small amount of challenge data provided. The actual deblurring pipeline consists of an approximate inversion of the radial lens distortion (determined by the estimated forward model) and a U-Net architecture, which is trained end-to-end. Our algorithm was the only one passing the hardest challenge level, achieving over 70% character recognition accuracy. Our findings are well in line with the paradigm of data-centric machine learning, and we demonstrate its effectiveness in the context of inverse problems. Apart from a detailed presentation of our methodology, we also analyze the importance of several design choices in a series of ablation studies.

It is organized in two parts. The first part studies the interpretability of predictions made by neural network classifiers. A key component for achieving interpretable classifications is the identification of relevant input features for the predictions. While several heuristic approaches towards this goal have been proposed, there is yet no generally agreed-upon definition of relevance. Instead, these heuristics typically rely on individual (often not explicitly stated) notions of interpretability, making comparisons of results difficult. The contribution of the first part of this thesis is the introduction of an explicit definition of relevance of input features for a classifier prediction and an analysis thereof. The formulation is based on a rate-distortion trade-off and derived from the observation and identification of common questions that practitioners would like to answer with relevance attribution methods. It turns out that answering these questions is extremely challenging: A computational complexity analysis reveals the hardness of determining the most relevant input features (even approximately) for Boolean classifiers as well as for neural network classifiers. This hardness in principle justifies the adoption of heuristic strategies and the explicit rate-distortion formulation inspires a novel approach that specifically aims at answering the identified questions of interest. Furthermore, it allows for a quantitative evaluation of relevance attribution methods, revealing that the newly proposed heuristic performs best in identifying the relevant input features compared to previous methods. The second part studies the accuracy and robustness of deep learning methods for the reconstruction of signals from undersampled indirect measurements. Such inverse problems arise for example in medical imaging, geophysics, communication, or astronomy. While widely used classical variational solution methods come with reconstruction guarantees (under suitable assumptions), the underlying mechanisms of data-driven methods are mostly not well understood from a mathematical perspective. Nevertheless, they show promising results and frequently empirically outperform classical methods in terms of reconstruction quality and speed. However, several doubts remain regarding their reliability, in particular questions concerning their robustness to perturbations. Indeed, for classification tasks it is well known that neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, i.e., tiny modifications that are visually imperceptible but mislead the neural network to make a wrong prediction. This raises the question if similar effects also occur in the context of signal recovery. The contribution of the second part of this thesis is an extensive numerical study of the robustness of a representative selection of end-to-end neural networks for solving inverse problems. It is demonstrated that for such regression problems (in contrast to classification) neural networks can be remarkably robust to adversarial and statistical perturbations. Furthermore, they show state-of-the-art performance resulting in highly accurate reconstructions: In the idealistic scenario of synthetic and perturbation-free data neural networks have the potential to achieve near-perfect reconstructions, i.e., their reconstruction error is close to numerical precision.","tags":["Deep Neural Networks","Explainable Neural Networks","Inverse Problems","Adversarial Examples","MRI","CT Reconstruction"],"title":"The Reliability of Deep Learning for Signal and Image Processing: Interpretability, Robustness, and Accuracy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jan Macdonald","Mathieu Besançon","Sebastian Pokutta"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1658534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658534400,"objectID":"e809a4517e05e569e0a333676f44e7fc","permalink":"https://jmaces.github.io/publication/macdonald-interpretable-2022/","publishdate":"2023-01-23T17:00:03.310664Z","relpermalink":"/publication/macdonald-interpretable-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"We study the effects of constrained optimization formulations and Frank-Wolfe algorithms for obtaining interpretable neural network predictions.

We prove that no invariant parametrised family of distributions can exist unless at least one of the following three restrictions holds: First, the network layers have a width of one, which is unreasonable for practical neural networks. Second, the probability measures in the family have finite support, which basically amounts to sampling distributions. Third, the parametrisation of the family is not locally Lipschitz continuous, which excludes all computationally feasible families.

Although neural networks often empirically outperform traditional reconstruction methods, their usage for sensitive medical applications remains controversial. Indeed, in a recent series of works, it has been demonstrated that deep learning approaches are susceptible to various types of instabilities, caused for instance by adversarial noise or out-of-distribution features. It is argued that this phenomenon can be observed regardless of the underlying architecture and that there is no easy remedy. Based on this insight, the present work demonstrates, how uncertainty quantification methods can be employed as instability detectors.

This is motivated by the task of interpreting predictions of binary classifiers described as Boolean circuits, which can be seen as special cases of neural networks. We show that the problem of deciding whether such subsets of relevant variables of limited size $k \\leq d$ exist is complete for the complexity class $\\mathsf{NP}^\\mathsf{PP}$ and thus, generally, unfeasible to solve. We then introduce a variant, in which it suffices to check whether a subset determines the function value with probability at least $\\delta$ or at most $\\delta-\\gamma$ for $0\u003c\\gamma\u003c\\delta$. This promise of a probability gap reduces the complexity to the class $\\mathsf{NP}^\\mathsf{BPP}$.

This holds even with the promise of a probability gap.","tags":["Complexity Theory","Explainable Neural Networks"],"title":"The Computational Complexity of Understanding Binary Classifier Decisions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jan Macdonald","Stephan Wäldchen","Sascha Hauch","Gitta Kutyniok"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1594944e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594944e3,"objectID":"8339032ad54fe96f86a9621a429b5d83","permalink":"https://jmaces.github.io/talk/explaining-neural-network-decisions-is-hard/","publishdate":"2020-08-17T22:02:01+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/explaining-neural-network-decisions-is-hard/","section":"event","summary":"**Poster:** Presentation of results based on our papers [A Rate-Distortion Framework for Explaining Neural Network Decisions](/publication/macdonald-rate-distortion-2019) and [The Computational Complexity of Understanding Network Decisions](/publication/waldchen-computational-2021).","tags":["Deep Learning","Deep Neural Networks","Explainable Neural Networks"],"title":"Explaining Neural Network Decisions Is Hard","type":"event"},{"authors":["Jan Macdonald","Stephan Wäldchen","Sascha Hauch","Gitta Kutyniok"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1593561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593561600,"objectID":"b1984c047c90720956f73fbfe433c66a","permalink":"https://jmaces.github.io/publication/macdonald-explaining-2020/","publishdate":"2022-01-07T15:49:22.532263Z","relpermalink":"/publication/macdonald-explaining-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"We connect the widespread idea of interpreting classiﬁer decisions to probabilistic prime implicants. A set of input features is deemed relevant for a classiﬁcation decision if the classiﬁer score remains nearly constant when randomising the remaining features. This introduces a rate-distortion trade-off between the set size and the deviation of the score. We explain how relevance maps can be interpreted as a greedy strategy to calculate the rate-distortion function. For neural networks we show that approximating this function even in a single point up to any non-trivial approximation factor is NP-hard. Thus, no algorithm will provably ﬁnd small relevant sets of input features even if they exist. Finally, as a numerical comparison we express a Boolean function, for which the prime implicant sets are known, as a neural network and investigate which relevance mapping methods are able to highlight them.","tags":["Deep Neural Networks","Explainable Neural Networks"],"title":"Explaining Neural Network Decisions Is Hard","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jan Macdonald","Stephan Wäldchen","Sascha Hauch","Gitta Kutyniok"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1571875200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571875200,"objectID":"258daa4655b0fdd4d3076fd3d0d2fd4a","permalink":"https://jmaces.github.io/talk/a-rate-distortion-framework-for-explaining-neural-network-decisions/","publishdate":"2020-08-17T22:00:58+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/a-rate-distortion-framework-for-explaining-neural-network-decisions/","section":"event","summary":"**Poster:** Presentation of results from our [paper](/publication/macdonald-rate-distortion-2019).","tags":["Deep Learning","Deep Neural Networks","Explainable Neural Networks"],"title":"A Rate-Distortion Framework for Explaining Neural Network Decisions","type":"event"},{"authors":["Jan Macdonald","Stephan Wäldchen","Sascha Hauch","Gitta Kutyniok"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567987200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567987200,"objectID":"a00761dfdb315af664432ef9e3ef8038","permalink":"https://jmaces.github.io/talk/a-rate-distortion-framework-for-explaining-neural-network-decisions/","publishdate":"2020-08-17T21:59:48+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/a-rate-distortion-framework-for-explaining-neural-network-decisions/","section":"event","summary":"**Poster:** Presentation of results from our [paper](/publication/macdonald-rate-distortion-2019).","tags":["Deep Learning","Deep Neural Networks","Explainable Neural Networks"],"title":"A Rate-Distortion Framework for Explaining Neural Network Decisions","type":"event"},{"authors":["Jan Macdonald","Stephan Wäldchen","Sascha Hauch","Gitta Kutyniok"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1563384600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563384600,"objectID":"8c7d7bb249881ccef61611070960432c","permalink":"https://jmaces.github.io/talk/a-rate-distortion-framework-for-explaining-deep-neural-network-decisions/","publishdate":"2020-08-17T21:59:26+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/a-rate-distortion-framework-for-explaining-deep-neural-network-decisions/","section":"event","summary":"**Invited Talk:** Presentation of results from our [paper](/publication/macdonald-rate-distortion-2019).","tags":["Deep Learning","Deep Neural Networks","Explainable Neural Networks"],"title":"A Rate-Distortion Framework for Explaining Deep Neural Network Decisions","type":"event"},{"authors":["Jan Macdonald","Stephan Wäldchen","Sascha Hauch","Gitta Kutyniok"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1562112e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562112e3,"objectID":"a8f474332e6d696b867792c6283d0640","permalink":"https://jmaces.github.io/talk/a-rate-distortion-framework-for-explaining-neural-network-decisions/","publishdate":"2020-08-17T21:59:21+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/a-rate-distortion-framework-for-explaining-neural-network-decisions/","section":"event","summary":"**Poster:** Presentation of results from our [paper](/publication/macdonald-rate-distortion-2019).","tags":["Deep Learning","Deep Neural Networks","Explainable Neural Networks"],"title":"A Rate-Distortion Framework for Explaining Neural Network Decisions","type":"event"},{"authors":["Jan Macdonald","Stephan Wäldchen","Sascha Hauch","Gitta Kutyniok"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1556668800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556668800,"objectID":"ef22235b1128580709e65d4b52800523","permalink":"https://jmaces.github.io/publication/macdonald-rate-distortion-2019/","publishdate":"2020-08-13T21:11:34.703609Z","relpermalink":"/publication/macdonald-rate-distortion-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"We formalise the widespread idea of interpreting neural network decisions as an explicit optimisation problem in a rate-distortion framework.

Our method corrects geometric deformations and intensity modulations present in EPI images. We consider a tailored variational image registration problem incorporating a physical distortion model and aiming at minimizing the distance of two oppositely distorted images subject to invertibility constraints. We derive a novel face-staggered discretization of the variational problem that renders the discretized distance function and constraints separable. Motivated by the presence of a smoothness regularizer, which leads to global coupling, we apply the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to split the problem into simpler subproblems. We prove the convergence of ADMM for this non-convex optimization problem. We show the superiority of our scheme compared to two state-of-the-art methods both in terms of correction quality and time-to-solution for 13 high-resolution 3D imaging datasets.","tags":["MRI","ADMM","Non-convex Optimization","Inverse Problems","Echo-Planar MRI"],"title":"Improved Susceptibility Artifact Correction of Echo-Planar MRI using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jan Macdonald"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1495065600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1495065600,"objectID":"ff6d610fbf7b32ec65da36efb3daf55c","permalink":"https://jmaces.github.io/publication/macdonald-thesis-2017/","publishdate":"2023-01-21T15:49:22.532263Z","relpermalink":"/publication/macdonald-thesis-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Deep Neural Networks","Image Classification","Scattering Transforms"],"title":"Image Classification with Wavelet and Shearlet Based Scattering Transforms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jan Macdonald"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1410825600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1410825600,"objectID":"30c080868b4e903fbb62efd8d94fd6b2","permalink":"https://jmaces.github.io/publication/macdonald-thesis-2014/","publishdate":"2023-01-20T15:49:22.532263Z","relpermalink":"/publication/macdonald-thesis-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Graph Algorithms","Combinatorial Optimization","Shortest Paths Algorithms"],"title":"Preprocessing for Shortest Path Algorithms on Road Networks","type":"publication"}]
